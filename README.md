# LeetCode Solutions

This repository contains my solutions to various LeetCode problems. Each file is named according to the problem number on LeetCode, making it easy to find the corresponding solution.

## Structure

- Each `.cpp` or `.c` file contains the solution for a specific LeetCode problem.
- The filename format is `<problem_number>.<extension>`, for example, `1452.cpp` corresponds to LeetCode problem 1452.

## Languages

- Most solutions are written in C++ (`.cpp`).
- Some solutions are written in C (`.c`).

## Usage

1. Find the file that matches the LeetCode problem number you are interested in.
2. Open the file to view the solution.
3. You can compile and run the C++ or C files using your preferred compiler.

### Example (for C++):
```sh
g++ 1452.cpp -o 1452
./1452
```

### Example (for C):
```sh
gcc 3136.c -o 3136
